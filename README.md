# Cross-market arbitrage monitor (`arbitrage-monitor`)

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

## Overview

`arbitrage-monitor` is a **Rust** application that discovers cross-venue relationships between **Polymarket** and **Kalshi** prediction markets, keeps a watchlist of high-confidence pairs, and evaluates executable economics from **live order-book data**. It performs **read-only analysis** and does not submit orders.

The pipeline combines text-based market matching (vector similarity and category rules), scheduled full refreshes and incremental tracking cycles, and structured logging under `logs/`.

## Features

- **Market data**: Loads open markets from the Polymarket Gamma API and the Kalshi Trade API, with configurable pagination and upper bounds.
- **Matching**: TF-IDF-style text vectors and cosine similarity; optional category constraints and scoring from `config/categories.toml`.
- **Execution-style PnL**: For each candidate pair, costs and net profit for a **notional-capped, depth-walked** buy scenario are derived from **parsed ask ladders** on both venues (see **Order-book PnL model**).
- **Tracking**: Maintains a set of tracked pairs across cycles, with periodic full rebuilds and parameter-driven intervals (`src/query_params.rs`).
- **Logging**: Cycle outputs and monitor CSVs under `logs/`; unmatched or low-signal items may be recorded under `logs/unclassified/`.

## Order-book PnL model

The scenario used for reporting (e.g. Top-10 and `net_profit_100`) is defined as follows:

1. **Order-book snapshots**  
   For a matched pair, the program requests the **current** Polymarket and Kalshi **order books** over HTTP and parses resting liquidity into **ascending ask ladders** `(price, size)`.

2. **Per-leg notional cap**  
   Each leg is allocated a maximum spend of **100 USDT** (`trade_amount` in `src/main.rs`). The ladder is traversed level by level until that cap is reached or liquidity is exhausted (`calculate_slippage_with_fixed_usdt` in `src/arbitrage_detector.rs`), yielding a **fillable contract count** per venue.

3. **Hedged size**  
   The scenario size **n** is the **minimum** of the two per-leg contract counts so that both legs can be notionally filled at the same size.

4. **Cost and profit at size n**  
   For exactly **n** contracts, per-leg total cost and **volume-weighted average prices** are recomputed by walking each ladder again (`cost_for_exact_contracts`). Combined legs yield **`capital_used`**. Platform fees and a fixed gas assumption are subtracted to obtain **`net_profit_100`**. A row is treated as an actionable opportunity when **`net_profit_100`** exceeds the detector’s configured minimum; this gate is applied to the depth-based result, not to a single-level quote in isolation.

**Implementation reference**: `validate_arbitrage_pair` in `src/main.rs`; `calculate_arbitrage_100usdt`, `calculate_slippage_with_fixed_usdt`, and `cost_for_exact_contracts` in `src/arbitrage_detector.rs`.

## Requirements

- **Rust** 1.70+ (stable recommended, `edition = "2021"`)
- Network access to the above public APIs (verify against current Kalshi and Polymarket documentation if endpoints or policies change)

## Quick start

```bash
cargo run              # debug
cargo run --release    # recommended for long runs
```

Ensure **`config/categories.toml`** exists before the first run (included in the repository).

## Configuration

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config/categories.toml` | Category names, weights, and keywords for classification and matching |
| `src/query_params.rs` | Request pacing, page limits, `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`, `SIMILARITY_TOP_K`, `FULL_FETCH_INTERVAL`, `RESOLUTION_HORIZON_DAYS`, etc. |

### Optional environment variables

- **`POLYMARKET_TAG_SLUG`**: When set, Polymarket market fetches may be restricted by tag (see `src/clients.rs`).
